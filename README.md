# talks

Welcome to the Go Maryland talk submission page! Find us [on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Go-Maryland/).

**To submit an idea**, copy the below Issue Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/GoMaryland/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, filling it out with your details. Doesn't need to be super detailed or formal like an abstract, just casually give us an idea of what you'll talk about. **OK GO!!!**

Not interested in speaking yourself, but have topics you'd like to see covered, or other ideas? Submit a "topic request"!

**To submit a topic request**, copy the below Topic Request Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/GoMaryland/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, and add your request. This doesn't have to be elaborate, but try not to be overly vague in your request. **HAVE AT IT!!!**

If you don't want to use GitHub, please feel free to message me [on Meetup](https://secure.meetup.com/messages/?new_convo=true) or DM me on twitter [@jboverfelt](https://twitter.com/jboverfelt)
